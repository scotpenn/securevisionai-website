## Archived Modules

### product-detail.js (Archived: 2025-10-01)

**Why Archived:**
- Product detail pages now use inline JavaScript for tab switching and gallery functionality
- The module was redundant with simpler inline implementations in templates
- Removing it reduces page load time and complexity

**Original Purpose:**
- Loaded and parsed compiled JSON product data
- Rendered product information dynamically (title, images, specs, etc.)
- Managed tab navigation and gallery interactions
- Provided error boundaries and friendly error messages

**Replacement:**
Product detail pages are now generated as static HTML with:
- All content pre-rendered from JSON5 â†’ JSON compilation
- Simple inline JavaScript for UI interactions (tabs, gallery)
- No need for JSON parsing or dynamic content loading

**If You Need to Restore:**
If dynamic product loading is needed in the future, this module provides:
- Comprehensive error handling with friendly UI messages
- Development logging helpers (isDev detection)
- Language detection and bilingual support
- Product data loading with fetch API
- Rendering functions for all product sections
